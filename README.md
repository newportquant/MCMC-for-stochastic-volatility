# MCMC-for-stochastic-volatility

This is companion code for blog post

[Stochastic Volatility Estimated by MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) Method](https://newportquant.com/stochastic-volatility-by-markov-chain-monte-carlo/)

Note:
1. Requires Matlab's Econometrics Toolbox and Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
2. The calculation of the multivariate effective sample size requires [multiESS.m from GitHub](https://github.com/lacerbi/multiESS)
